# Troubleshooting

Start with looking at the `wgsl-analyzer` version.
Try the **wgsl-analyzer: Show WA Version** in VS Code (using **Command Palette** feature.
It is typically activated by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) or `wgsl-analyzer --version` in the command line. <!-- spellchecker:disable-line -->
If the date is more than a week ago, it is better to update your installation of wgsl-analyzer to the newest version.

The next thing to check would be panic messages in `wgsl-analyzer`'s log.
Log messages are printed to stderr, in VS Code you can see them in the `Output > WGSL Analyzer Language Server` tab of the panel.
To see more logs, set the `WA_LOG=info` environment variable, this can be done either by setting the environment variable manually or by using `wgsl-analyzer.server.extraEnv`.
Note that both of these approaches require the server to be restarted.

To fully capture LSP messages between the editor and the server, run the `wgsl-analyzer: Toggle LSP Logs` command and check `Output > WGSL Analyzer Language Server Trace`.

The root cause for many "nothing works" problems is that `wgsl-analyzer` fails to understand the project structure.
To debug that, first note the `wgsl-analyzer` section in the status bar.
If it has an error icon and red, that is the problem (hover will have somewhat helpful error message).
**wgsl-analyzer: Status** prints dependency information for the current file.
Finally, `WA_LOG=project_model=debug` enables verbose logs during project loading.

If wgsl-analyzer outright crashes, try running `wgsl-analyzer analysis-stats /path/to/project/directory/` on the command line.
This command type checks the whole project in batch mode bypassing LSP machinery.

When filing issues, it is useful (but not necessary) to try to minimize examples.
An ideal bug reproduction looks like this:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git && cd repo && git switch --detach commit-hash
$ wgsl-analyzer --version
wgsl-analyzer dd12184e4 2021-05-08 dev
$ wgsl-analyzer analysis-stats .
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€
```

It is especially useful when the `repo` does not use external crates or the standard library.

If you want to go as far as to modify the source code to debug the problem, be sure to take a look at the [dev docs](https://github.com/wgsl-analyzer/wgsl-analyzer/tree/master/docs/dev)!
