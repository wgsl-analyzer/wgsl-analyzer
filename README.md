# wgsl-analyzer

wgsl-analyzer is a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) plugin for the [WGSL Shading language](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/).

It comes with a [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) plugin located in [./editors/code](./editors/code), but due to the nature of the language server protocol it should be possible to create plugins for other editors as well.

## Installation (VS Code)

The extension is [published on the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wgsl-analyzer.wgsl-analyzer), so you can simply download the extension like any other.

If you are not using a platform for which the vscode extension ships prebuilt binaries (currently only windows-x64, linux-x64 and macos-x64), then you need to compile the language server yourself:
```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/wgsl-analyzer/wgsl-analyzer wgsl_analyzer
```

Specify the server path in the settings:

```json
{
    "wgsl-analyzer.server.path": "~/.cargo/bin/wgsl_analyzer"
}
```

## Building from source

The lsp server can be built using `cargo build --release -p wgsl_analyzer`.

The vscode extension can either be built as a platform-specific extension which bundles the language server binary, or as a platform-independant one.

**Install node modules:**

`cd editors/code && npm install`

**Platform independent extension:**

`cd editors/code && npm run package`

**Platform-specific extension:**

Copy the server binary (either `wgsl_analyzer` or `wgsl_analyzer.exe`) into `./editors/code/out/`, then run
`npm run package -- --target <target> -o wgsl_analyzer-<target>.vsix` where the target is one of the targets listed as [platform-specific extension targets](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#platformspecific-extensions).

## Design

The design is heavily inspired (and in large parts copied from) [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer).
See [rust-analyzer/docs/dev/architecture.md](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/architecture.md) for a summary of the architecture.
